Implementation of Training Data Poisoning for Imperfect Information Games, Guy Aridor, Natania Wolansky, Jisha Jacob, Iddo Drori, 2018.

Most of the recent breakthrough work in artificial intelligence has been in developing agents that can play difficult multi-agent games such as chess, shogi, Go, or poker at super-human levels. However, are these agents susceptible to defeat by strategic agents with little computational power but with the ability to bias training? In real world chess and poker tournaments, grandmasters and expert players often use strategies of deception in practice rounds and early rounds of the tournament to confuse their opponents about the strategies they employ later on.  This work explores how simple strategies in the game of Leduc Holdâ€™em can be used to beat a sophisticated poker AI, DeepStack.  We first implement agents that exhibit the behavioral biases that have been empirically observed in individuals playing poker. We then play these sub-optimal agents against an unbiased trained DeepStack and show how significantly DeepStack outperforms these traditional strategy profiles.  We then consider the ability of an opponent to bias the training phase such that DeepStack is optimized to play against a particular strategy profile as opposed to approximatinga Nash Equilibrium.  Finally, by allowing for this biasing, we show that DeepStack can be defeated by a subset of strategy profiles if the player can change their strategy post-training. While DeepStack achieves nearly super-human performance, we conclude that DeepStack is susceptible to training poisoning.

## Libraries:
torch 
lua
luarocks
luasocket

# To Run a Match:

## Environment Setup 
1. Run make in the ACPCServer Directory: 
`cd DeepStack-Leduc/ACPCServer`
`make`
2. Setup the acpc client (Note: Ensure you are using Python 3):
`cd ruleBased-Players/acpc-python-client/`
`python setup.py install`

## Configuring the Game & Players
1. Connect the server by starting the dealer. Run the following command: 
`./DeepStack-Leduc/ACPCServer/dealer <name_of_game> ./DeepStack-Leduc/ACPCServer/leduc.game <#hands> <rngSeed> <p1name> <p2name> -p 20000,20001 <name_of_output_file>`
2. In a separate tab, connect Player 1
3. In a separate tab, connect Player 2

### Players and how to connect them:

#### Simple Control Players:
Three control players were used that modeled the "Always Call", "All In" and "Random" playing profiles.

always_call.py -- always calls
`python ./ruleBased-Players/ESMCCFR-LEDUC/always_call.py ./DeepStack-Leduc/ACPCServer/leduc.game localhost <port>`

allin_net.py -- always raises max amount:
`python ./ruleBased-Players/ESMCCFR-LEDUC/allin_net.py ./DeepStack-Leduc/ACPCServer/leduc.game localhost <port>`

selects random valid action:
`./DeepStack-Leduc/ACPCServer/example_player ./DeepStack-Leduc/ACPCServer/leduc.game localhost <port>`

#### Rule-based irrational players:
Two conservative playing profiles were explore in this project. To run them, use the following commands.

Rocks Player (very conservative):
`python ./ruleBased-Players/ESMCCFR-LEDUC/rocks.py ./DeepStack-Leduc/ACPCServer/leduc.game localhost <port>`

Passive Rocks Player (less conservative):
`python ./ruleBased-Players/ESMCCFR-LEDUC/passiveRocks.py ./DeepStack-Leduc/ACPCServer/leduc.game localhost <port>`

#### "Smart" Irrational Players:
Four semi-rational and irrational playing profiles were built on top of DeepStack. To run them, use the following commands.

Random Bluffer (always plays on port 20001):
`cd ./DeepStack-Leduc/Source`
`th Player_RandomizedBluffer/deepstack.lua`

Semi Bluffer (always plays on port 20001):
`cd ./DeepStack-Leduc/Source`
`th Player_SmartBluffer/deepstack.lua`

Mild Adaptive Rocks (always plays on port 20001):
`cd ./DeepStack-Leduc/Source`
`th Player_MildAdaptiveRocks/deepstack.lua`

Strong Adaptive Rocks (always plays on port 20001):
`cd ./DeepStack-Leduc/Source`
`th Player_StrongAdaptiveRocks/deepstack.lua`

#### Rational Player:
To run a pretrained Deepstack (always plays on port 20000):
`cd ./DeepStack-Leduc/Source`
`th Player_DeepStack/deepstack.lua`
